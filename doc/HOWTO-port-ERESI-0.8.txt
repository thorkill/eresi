 ------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear ERESI users and developers,

Since The ELF shell and the Embedded ELF debugger starts to be
really modular and we now have a complete separation between
portable parts and non-portable parts using our handlers system,
let's see how to port it on a new architecture or a new OS. This
system is also now used in the Kernel shell and it has proven
perfectly adapted to develop highly portable software in the 
ERESI framework.

Each of these componant has a certain number of internal hooks,
called "aspect vector" in the code, that can be created to
demultiplex a particular non-standard feature for which the
implementation is different from one OS to another, or from
one architecture to another, or from one binary target file to 
another, and so on.


1. THE VECTOR API
-----------------

The structure of a vector is vector_t. All vectors are stored
and looked up using a hash table. The vector name can lookup 
the vector data structure in the hash table. Each vector is a
multi-dimensional array of function pointers. Each function pointer
corresponds to the implementation for a given combination
of architecture, OS, file type, (or more generally, any 
information you wish to discriminate on).


/* Retreive pointer on the vector hash table */
hash_t*         aspect_vecthash_get();

/* Retreive a vector from the vectors hash table */
vector_t*       aspect_vector_get(char *name);

/* Add a new vector in the vectors hash table */
int             aspect_register_vector(char *, void*, 
                                       unsigned int*,
                                       char **, unsigned int, 
                                       unsigned int);

/* Add the function pointer to the vector at requested coordonates */
void            aspect_vectors_insert(vector_t *vect, 
                                      unsigned int *dim, 
                                      unsigned long fct);

/* Get the function pointer at given position in the vector */
void*           aspect_vectors_select(vector_t *vect, 
                                      unsigned int *dim);


Additionally, another API can be useful, but you certainly
dont need it if you dont touch in the scripting engine:


/* Project each dimension and get the cell pointer containing
   the desired element in the vector (useful for update) */
void            *aspect_vectors_selectptr(vector_t *vect, 
                                          unsigned int *dim);


Here is the list of hooks to be implemented as backends in order to 
complete a full port on some unsupported OS or architecture.

2. LIBELFSH PORTING
-------------------


Adding the ALTPLT handler for ALTPLT redirection for an architecture/OS/filetype

* ELFSH_HOOK_REL	  : The relocation function used in ET_REL injection
* ELFSH_HOOK_CFLOW	  : The routine performing static function hijacking
* ELFSH_HOOK_PLT	  : The routine performing external function hijacking
* ELFSH_HOOK_ALTPLT	  : The routine performing a more elaborate external function hijacking
* ELFSH_HOOK_EXTPLT	  : The routine performing partial binary relinking
* ELFSH_HOOK_ENCODEPLT	  : The routine encoding a new PLT entry
* ELFSH_HOOK_ENCODEPLT1	  : The routine reencoding the first PLT entry
* ELFSH_HOOK_ARGC	  : The routine performig function argument counting


Be also sure to add a 'case' in those information switch located in the functions :

int       elfsh_get_pagesize(elfshobj_t *file)
u_int     elfsh_get_breaksize(elfshobj_t *file)

If you add the support for a new OS, do the same in :

u_char    elfsh_get_ostype(elfshobj_t *file)
u_char    elfsh_get_real_ostype(elfshobj_t *file)

and add your OS in :

u_char  elfsh_ostype[5] = {
  ELFOSABI_LINUX,
  [....]
  ADD YOUR OS HERE
};



If you add the support for a new architecture, do the same in :

u_char    elfsh_get_archtype(elfshobj_t *file);

All of this beeing located in libelfsh/hooks.c.



You can use this internal API for adding your own hooks entries directly in the 
elfsh_setup_hooks() function, without having to use the vector API directly:

int     elfsh_register_breakhook(u_char archtype, u_char objtype, u_char ostype, void *fct);
int     elfsh_register_cflowhook(u_char archtype, u_char objtype, u_char ostype, void *fct);
int     elfsh_register_relhook(u_char archtype, u_char objtype, u_char ostype, void *fct);
int     elfsh_register_plthook(u_char archtype, u_char objtype, u_char ostype, void *fct);
int     elfsh_register_altplthook(u_char archtype, u_char objtype, u_char ostype, void *fct);


When requesting a feature from one of the command in elfsh/e2dbg/etrace/kernsh, the code
implementing this command remains in librevm/cmd/commandname.c . Such code calls the internal
libelfsh API. On its turn, the libelfsh API calls the  vector API provided by libaspect. For
each portable feature architectured using a vector, there is one libelfsh function which is
called:


libelfsh/relinject.c     ret = elfsh_rel(new->parent, new, reloc, dword, addr, mod);

libelfsh/hijack.c        ret = elfsh_plt(file, symbol, addr);

libelfsh/altplt.c        if (elfsh_altplt(file, &newsym, addr) < 0)

libelfsh/bp.c            ret = elfsh_setbreak(file, bp);

libelfsh/hijack.c        ret = elfsh_cflow(file, name, symbol, addr);

libelfsh/hijack.c        ret = elfsh_cflow(file, name, symbol, addr);



II. E2DBG PORTING
-----------------


Now we have a certain number of hooks inside e2dbg directly. Those are most related
to the scripting language and the relations with stepping and access to registers
context or processor state for all architectures. The list of hooks in e2dbg/vmhooks 
is as follow :

./libe2dbg/dbghooks.c:  getpc = aspect_vector_get(E2DBG_HOOK_GETPC);
./libe2dbg/dbghooks.c:  getfp = aspect_vector_get(E2DBG_HOOK_GETFP);
./libe2dbg/dbghooks.c:  nextfp = aspect_vector_get(E2DBG_HOOK_NEXTFP);
./libe2dbg/dbghooks.c:  getret = aspect_vector_get(E2DBG_HOOK_GETRET);
./libe2dbg/dbghooks.c:  setregs = aspect_vector_get(E2DBG_HOOK_SETREGS);
./libe2dbg/dbghooks.c:  getregs = aspect_vector_get(E2DBG_HOOK_GETREGS);
./libe2dbg/dbghooks.c:  setstep = aspect_vector_get(E2DBG_HOOK_SETSTEP);
./libe2dbg/dbghooks.c:  resetstep = aspect_vector_get(E2DBG_HOOK_RESETSTEP);
./libe2dbg/dbghooks.c:  breakp = aspect_vector_get(E2DBG_HOOK_BREAK);

Those hooks are used for :

- E2DBG_HOOK_GETPC	 : Returning a pointer on the Program Counter context entry for later read or write
- E2DBG_HOOK_GETFP	 : Returning a pointer on the Frame Pointer context entry for later read or write
- E2DBG_HOOK_NEXTFP	 : Returning the next Frame Pointer giving the actual Frame Pointer
- E2DBG_HOOK_GETRET	 : Returning the current Return address depending on the actual Frame Pointer
- E2DBG_HOOK_SETREGS	 : Update the ucontext registers entries for further reuse by the debuggee program
- E2DBG_HOOK_GETREGS	 : Obtain the ucontext registers entries for further modifications in the debugger
- E2DBG_HOOK_SETSTEP	 : Enable the singlestep mode on the processor
- E2DBG_HOOK_RESETSTEP	 : Disable the singlestep mode on the processor
- E2DBG_HOOK_BREAK	 : Install a breakpoint

Again, we have an API that allow for registering hooks for a given architecture, host type (user, kernel.. ) and OS type :

int      e2dbg_register_sregshook(u_char     archtype, u_char hosttype, u_char ostype, void *fct); # register a setreg handler
int      e2dbg_register_gregshook(u_char     archtype, u_char hosttype, u_char ostype, void *fct); # register a getreg handler
int      e2dbg_register_getpchook(u_char     archtype, u_char hosttype, u_char ostype, void *fct); # register a getpc handler
int      e2dbg_register_setstephook(u_char   archtype, u_char hosttype, u_char ostype, void *fct); # register a setstep handler
int      e2dbg_register_resetstephook(u_char archtype, u_char hosttype, u_char ostype, void *fct); # register a resetstep handler
int      e2dbg_register_nextfphook(u_char    archtype, u_char hosttype, u_char ostype, void *fct); # register a nextfp handler
int      e2dbg_register_getrethook(u_char    archtype, u_char hosttype, u_char ostype, void *fct); # register a getret handler                                  


Those e2dbg hooks, once registered, are called from e2dbg at various place, that you should not have to modify.
As stated before, the only thing you have to do when adding a new handler for a new combination of OS/arch/binarytype
for a given feature is to use the above mentioned API for the correct feature. The location of the libelfsh interface
for *calling* your function pointer or retreiving it from the vector is hidden, even to the programmer, using these
functions:


e2dbg/signal.c            e2dbg_getregs();

e2dbg/continue.c          e2dbg_setregs();

e2dbg/signal.c            pc = e2dbg_getpc();

e2dbg/backtrace.c         frame = (elfsh_Addr) e2dbg_getfp();

e2dbg/signal.c            e2dbg_setstep();

e2dbg/signal.c            e2dbg_resetstep();

e2dbg/backtrace.c         frame = e2dbg_nextfp(world.curjob->current, (elfsh_Addr) frame);    

e2dbg/backtrace.c         ret = (elfsh_Addr) e2dbg_getret(world.curjob->current, (elfsh_Addr) frame);

                                  
You can add your additional support directly in e2dbg/dbghooks.c:e2dbg_setup_hooks()
in the form of calls to e2dbg_register_*() function calls (depending on the feature you
are porting).



III. LIBASM PORTING:
--------------------

FIXME



IV. LIBKERNSH PORTING:

Due to the diffence between each systems, we have a lot's of hooks :

vectors.c:  aspect_register_vector(LIBKERNSH_VECTOR_NAME_KLOADMODULE,

This is the API that allow for registering hooks for a given architecture and OS type :

int	kernsh_register_openmem(u_int, u_int, u_int, void *);	# register a openmem handler
int	kernsh_register_closemem(u_int, u_int, u_int, void *);	# register a closemem handler

symbs.c:  symbs = aspect_vector_get(LIBKERNSH_VECTOR_NAME_ADDRBYNAME);
symbs.c:  symbs = aspect_vector_get(LIBKERNSH_VECTOR_NAME_NAMEBYADDR);



V. ALGORITHM INFORMATION RELEVANT TO PORTING
----------------------------------------------

Some features like ALTGOT, ALTPLT, and EXTPLT are kind of complementary and more easily implemented
in a single algorithm. This algorithm is located in libelfsh/altplt.c:elfsh_relink_plt() and more
generally the functions located in that file are used for it. It is work in progress to think how
this function could be modularized more than how it currently done. If you feel like adding small
fixes for your architecture, please do it in proper conditions, respecting the convention used in
the file.

- ALTGOT redirection (see altplt.c + libelfsh/altgot.c for that), works on MIPS & ALPHA for now, 
and UNTESTED ALL RISC architectures. Should not need a dedicated hook.

- EXTPLT postlinking (see altplt.c + libelfsh/extplt.c for that), works on IA32, UNTESTED on all 
other architectures, one hook will be added to virtualize the PLT reencoding.

In libelfsh, all architecture dependant hooks entry are located in a file dedicated to the 
architecture. You can find those in libelfsh/ia*,mips*,sparc*,alpha64.c files. Please place
your handler functions entries there in libelfsh.

In e2dbg, if you do the support for a new architecture, create a new file and add it in the Makefile
of the local directory. Current supported architectures are INTEL (dbg-intel.c) and SPARC (dbg-sparc32.c).


VI. OTHER SPECIAL PORTING CONSIDERATIONS
----------------------------------------

You may want to know special considerations on porting stuff on exotic architectures:

* If the architecture does not support singlestepping natively (like MIPS), you may need to add a state
to the counter variable in the generic breakpoint handler for obtaining the correct result in the debugger. 
This is located in e2dbg/signal.c:e2dbg_generic_breakpoint() .

* ALTGOT and ALTPLT are complementary, if you implement one of them on an architecture, you dont need the
other one.

* All quoted features works on both ET_EXEC and ET_DYN ELF objects. Please verify that your handlers
works on both types as well, or precise which kind of ELF object your handlers are manipulating while
you register them.

* Be careful with the difference between a libelfsh hook and a e2dbg hook. The first is parametrised by a 
ELF file type (ET_EXEC, ET_DYN, ..), the second is parametrized by a HOST type (for now, only PROC, but
will be used in the future for the KERNEL target. We could imagine more specialized target as well, like
the NOFP target, or stuff like that).

* If you want to add a hook, there is not yet an API to do that but you can copy an existing one, located
in libelfsh/hooks.c or e2dbg/dbghooks.c, depending on the interaction level of it (ONDISK vs MEMORY hooks).

If you read this file and wish to participate in the porting of ERESI, and you are not subscribed
