ELFsh allocator library README file

This allocator is ptmalloc2 (http://www.malloc.de/malloc/ptmalloc2.tar.gz) patched
in quite a straightforward manner to allow only using mmap and no sbrk. The second
feature added is the ability to register a thread ID that will use a separate arena
and will leave the original process use the original heap as if the current thread
was not existing.

The implementation is independant of any thread library (it was tested on Solaris, 
BSD, and Linux with different thread implementations) and allow the Embedded ELF
Debugger (e2dbg) to be non-intrusive on the legit program heap management.
