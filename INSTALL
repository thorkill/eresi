How to build the ERESI framework. This includes:

- elfsh, e2dbg, and etrace 
- the language interpreter and type system libraries : librevm and libaspect
- analysis libraries : libelfsh, libe2dbg, libedfmt, libasm, and libmjollnir
- the interface library (readline based) : libui

You will need openssl headers. Debian users should install openssl-dev.

Make sure you have enough free space on your filesystem,
build of 32-64 objects can take up to 800MB!

1. ./configure --help (select your options)
2. make
3. make install (optional, you can test from e2dbg/e2dbg and vm/elfsh)
4. cd testsuite && make (optional)

If you want to test without installing, you need to do :

5. source env.sh

from the root directory of the project. This will change your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable for using uninstalled libraries.


Read each directory README file for more information.
