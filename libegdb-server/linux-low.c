   If we continue the process using PTRACE_CONT, we will get a

   the instruction after the breakpoint (i.e. needs to be
   decremented).  If we report the SIGTRAP to GDB, we must also
   report the undecremented PC.  If we cancel the SIGTRAP, we
   must resume at the decremented PC.

   (Presumably, not yet tested) On a non-decr_pc_after_break machine

   If we single-step over a breakpoint instruction, our PC will
